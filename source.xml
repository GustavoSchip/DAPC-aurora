			<p>Add new options for necromancy, blood magic, and shadow magic with this supplement for the worldâ€™s greatest roleplaying game.</strong></p>
			<p>In many adventures and campaigns, necromancy and similar magic often plays a key role in the story. This supplement aims to give both players and DMs more 
			options in these types of campaigns by giving them more races, subclasses, spells, and creatures for them to work with. If your dungeon master allows, these 
			options can be used in any of your campaigns.</p>
