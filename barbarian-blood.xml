			<p>The Path of Blood is a path taken by only the most ruthless and battle-hungry barbarians. They do not care when they shed their own blood - in fact, they use that 
			energy to empower their rage even farther, using their suffering to inflict wounds upon their foes through magical bonds of blood.</p>
			<p class="indent">While at first glance the Path of Blood appears to be powered by the same forces as the Path of the Berserker, the Path of Blood is far more magical 
			in nature. Bloodragers use their blood in a form of hemomancy - a magic that utilizes blood sacrifices.</p>
