		<description>
			<p>The archetypal Blood Knight employs their own flesh and blood in the slaughter of their enemies. To a Blood Knight, battle is everything. It isn’t winning or losing that drives them so much as it is the opportunity for a good fight. And when they find that fight, they use everything they have to contest their opponent. They utilize blood sacrifices to cast spells and grant themselves additional offensive and defensive capabilities, though at a steep cost.</p>

			<p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast hemomancy spells, detailed in chapter 3 of this companion.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Blood Knight table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">During a short rest, you can choose to regain one of your blood knight spell slots. Once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</em></strong> You know two 1st-level hemomancy spells of your choice, chosen from the hemomancy spells detailed in chapter 3.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Blood Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more hemomancy spells of 1st level or higher. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the hemomancy spells you know with another hemomancy spell of your choice. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your blood knight spells, since your spells are powered through the resilience of your body. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a blood knight spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier</p>

You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Superiority Dice.</em></strong> You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it.
