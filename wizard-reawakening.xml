			<p>As a member of the school of reawakening, you combine the forces of necromancy with the power of conjuration. By transforming the necromantic energies of the creatures you kill into completely new conjurations, you bridge the gap between these two school of magic, creating a hybrid school that combines elements of both Conjuration and Necromancy. As you progress, you learn to shape together ever more powerful conjurations.</p>

			<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

			<p>By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.</p>
			<p class="indent">The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.</p>
